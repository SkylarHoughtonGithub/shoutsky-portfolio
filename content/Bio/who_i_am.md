**Nature. 🌱** 
Originally from the Wasatch mountains, ive lived in the Nashville Basin long enough to be considered native. Recently, I've found a new love in the serene embrace of the Blue Ridge Mountains but ultimately love any vast naturescape. The transition from the majestic Wasatch to the rolling beauty of the Blue Ridge has enriched my perspective, much like the diverse challenges of the DevOps realm.

**Strategy. ♟️**
Beyond the world of payloads and packets, when not crafting seamless systems, you'll catch me immersed in progressive metal symphonies, classical orchestrations, a strategy or platform game, a philospophical book, or spending time with my family. The precision required to synchronize complex melodies mirrors my approach to automating the tech landscape, where every line of code is a note in a grand composition.

**Engines. 🚀** 
Whether it be a roaring 350 v8, a green PRS paired with a Randall stack, a VM with GPU passthrough with a container on top, Multi Petabyte data lake, any complex machine captivates my fascination. Finding weak spots and advantage points, testing and optimizing every system to fulfill the mission.

**Growth. 🧠**
My journey isn't just about learning and conquering all *the* complex systems; it's a testament to the discipline instilled from the beginning of my journey to succeed. Failure is not a setback but a call to prepare to climb higher. We are all capable of what we put our minds to. 

**I am who I am. 🤘🏻**
In the intersection of technology and nature, I bring a unique blend of passion, strategy, and resilience. Together, let's conquer new peaks in this ever-evolving landscape.
