<h2 id="by-day-i-am-skylar-by-night-i-am-jank">By day I am Skylar. By night I am Jank.</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been obssessed with computers since I first seen one.</p>
<p>Ive always had a drive thats made me go confront the next unknown and enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>I have a deep passion for music, I enjoy  video games, and am a big self study advocate.</p>
<p>Out of high school I attended a local technical college that gave me my first IT and systems administration education. During this tenure, I was involved with Hyper-V servers, Active Directory systems, Cisco enterprise routers, switches and Fortigate firewalls. I showed up on the weekends to work with my instructor to patch the workstations for the college as well as installing new Ubiquiti WAP&rsquo;s for better Wi-Fi throughout the school. I worked the helpdesk here to do desktop support and some network administration. My &ldquo;capstone&rdquo; of this experience was setting up 2 active directory controllers that communicated across 2 VLANS in a replicated setup, as well as a firewall for content filtering purposes. I was the class president in my 2 remaining trimesters, and got my first job refurbishing laptops while doing a co-op program for final college credits.</p>
<p>I made my true entry career wise working on secure shells and complex digital signage systems that provide public kiosks anonymity as a service as well as the logistics for hardware and network support. I functioned as a subject matter expert for complex bill to room systems that involved an IIS/ASP.NET web backend and Nomadix and Digibox systems that provided bill to room, captive portal services, content filtering and Wi-Fi for hotels. I also started a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree at WGU for Cloud &amp; Systems administration at this point, which I completed 3 years into the program. I started advancing my skillset with a discovered love of Linux. Once I was to a point I could expand on that, I found that DevOps tools that enabled automation was some of the most fun projects I have worked on and always try to incorporate this mindset with projects. This evolved into an awakening of the importance of security on an environment. Learning how to harden and prevent attacks is a precious toolset to have a grasp on. Combining this with public cloud infrastructure, private datacenter infrastructure or a hybrid between them is the toolset I am constantly evolving and striving to have mastered. I am always trying to design, optimize and execute projects for building tools that solve bigger problems in more seamless ways that also bypass the traditional mindset of downtime or performance limitations while setting new levels for efficiency.</p>
<p>After watching notes collect on projects I have been involved with, I figured I would organize them, clean them up, and add lessons learned when appropriate in a blog format or advertise my code on github. Not only does it help give me a place to review my achievements, I could also give back to the community, which has graciously provided me with an honest amount of the information i&rsquo;ve used so far.</p>
<p>I believe in open source because it has been people willing to take a step back and share their work that helps make the world a better place. Make sure to follow my work here on the blog, and <a href="https://github.com/jankeemunkey">Github</a>.</p>
<p>I am also on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/skylarhoughton/">LinkedIn</a> if you are interested in a discussion.</p>
