<p>I&rsquo;ve been obssessed with computers since I first seen one.</p>
<p>Ive always had a drive thats made me go confront the next unknown and enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>I have a deep passion for music, I enjoy  video games, and am a big self study advocate.</p>
<p>Professionally I have ranged from an application support specialist to a systems engineer. I have experience in PCI-DSS a environment, and helped maintain HIPAA compliance.</p>
<p>After watching notes collect on projects I have been involved with, I figured I would organize them, clean them up, and add lessons learned as well when appropriate. Not only does it help give me a place to review my achievements, I could also give back to the community, which has graciously provided me with an honest amount of the information i&rsquo;ve used so far.</p>
<p>I believe in open source because it has been people willing to take a step back and share their work that helps make the world a better place. Make sure to follow my work here on the blog, and <a href="https://github.com/jankeemunkey">Github</a>.</p>
<p>I am also on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/skylarhoughton/">LinkedIn</a> if you are interested in a discussion.</p>
