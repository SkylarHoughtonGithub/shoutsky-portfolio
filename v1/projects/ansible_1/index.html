    <h2 id="what-is-it">What is it</h2>
<p>It would be best if this was made into a series of articles as opposed to one behemoth that has all the information of Ansible. That way I can share my experiences and opinions on the software as well as the utilization methods along the way.</p>
<p>The moment I learned the true power of Ansible in any form was the starting point of the Intermediate phase of my career. I had heard of Ansible, Chef and Salt on Reddit but never thought it to be important. After all, one machine in a vacuum hardly seems like something that needs help containing. When I finally got in a production environment and needed to be able to have full control of my fleet is when I started taking it serious.</p>
<p>To clarify, Ansible core is another term for the CLI form of Ansible. It can have the form of CLI or an HTTP API interface that gives you an overlay of the engine with other features. We are explicitly talking about the CLI form on this article.</p>
<p>To start, one must have an environment with Python binaries installed. Preferably Linux. whether it be Redhat based or Debian based needs to install Ansible from the package manager of choice;</p>
<h3 id="for-rhel-based">For RHEL-based:</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">yum install ansible
</code></pre></div><h3 id="for-debian-based">For Debian-based:</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">apt install software-properties-common
apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
apt install ansible
</code></pre></div><p> </p>
<p>Once Ansible is installed, you need to connect it to its clients. Its clients being defined as web servers, database servers, storage servers, network equipment, firewalls,&hellip;&hellip;.. that ancient box everyone wonders about that accepts ssh&hellip;&hellip;it might work with Ansible.</p>
<p>The RSA public key that enables this one way trust allows our tower to send commands to our nodes.</p>
<p><strong>How this key is stored and exchanged is under your complete discretion.</strong></p>
<h2 id="jank-tip">Jank Tip</h2>
<p>The free and easy way to get consumed by Ansible is to create an ansible service account that follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(computer_security)">AAA</a> security model that can also do administrative tasks on any neccessary node on a schedule.</p>
<p>If you wanted my advice, I might say that I would be able to join that box to a domain and create a service account to manage the domain with.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I might also say an LDAP server could work to have a Linux native version of this. The point is, theres plenty of ways to do this crucial piece.</p>
<p>you can test your connection with a simple, yet very verbose command that will tell you if you have accomplished what you set out to do:</p>
<p><code>ansible -i &lt;inventory&gt; -m setup</code></p>
<p>you&rsquo;ll get some kind of output as such:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">10.0.0.4 | SUCCESS =&gt; {
    &#34;ansible_facts&#34;: {
        ],
        &#34;module_setup&#34;: true
    [
    },
    &#34;changed&#34;: false
}
</code></pre></div><p>You know the connection is a success at this point.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-down-the-playbook-structure">Breaking Down the Playbook Structure</h2>
<p>Playbooks are what make Ansible magic.</p>
