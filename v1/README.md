Personal resume website produced from the Go-based static HTML site generator, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

The output of the hugo site was produced by running `hugo -d <destination>`. This output was placed in this repository and hosted with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

The FQDN of the website is customizable through a [CNAME](https://github.com/JankeeMunkey/static-jank-site/blob/master/CNAME) file in the repository. Of course, a public domain name must be purchased before doing this.
